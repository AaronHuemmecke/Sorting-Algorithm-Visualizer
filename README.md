# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
This is a program for interactively visualizing sorting algorithms. It aims to explain sorting algorithms to you in a clear way step by step.

The program is divided into three different sections that you can freely navigate through: 
1. In the section **Explanation** there are explanatory texts regarding the basics of sorting algorithms. Moreover, some sorting algorithms are described textually and graphically.
2. In the section **Algorithm Visualization** there is a tool that you can use to execute different sorting algorithms and see a graphic visualization, explanations and further information at the same time.
3. In the section **Algorithm Quiz** you can check if you can recognize a sorting algorithm by its visualization and thereby test your understanding of the different sorting algorithms.

The program currently supports the languages German and English.


You can download the current version of the program as an executable JAR file in the [release section](https://github.com/AaronHuemmecke/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer/releases). Otherwise, you can clone the source code and [build a JAR file on your own](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/packaging-a-module-into-a-jar-file.html).

Please **feel free to contribute to this project**, for example by using of a pull request.
