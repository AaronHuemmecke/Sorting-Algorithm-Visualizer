# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
This is a program for interactively visualizing sorting algorithms. It aims to explain sorting algorithms to you in a clear way step by step.

The program is divided into three different sections that you can freely navigate through: 
1. In the section **Explanation** there are explanatory texts regarding the basics of sorting algorithms. Moreover, some sorting algorithms are described textually and graphically.
2. In the section **Algorithm Visualization** there is a tool that you can use to execute different sorting algorithms and see a graphic visualization, explanations and further information at the same time.
3. In the section **Algorithm Quiz** you can check if you can recognize a sorting algorithm by its visualization and thereby test your understanding of the different sorting algorithms.

The program currently supports the languages German and English.
